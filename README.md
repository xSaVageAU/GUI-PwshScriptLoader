# SavGUI_ScriptLoader

***SavGUI*** is a PowerShell-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to simplify the management and execution of PowerShell scripts.
It provides an intuitive interface for browsing and running scripts.

In it's current version it will grab a list of all .ps1 powershell scripts in specific "Themes" and "Patches" directories, then list them in their respective menu.
