# GUI-PwshScriptLoader 

***PwshScriptLoader*** is a PowerShell-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to simplify the management and execution of PowerShell scripts.
It provides an intuitive interface for browsing and running scripts.

In it's current version it will grab a list of all .ps1 powershell scripts in `Resources\Scripts\Themes` and `Resources\Scripts\Patches`, then lists them in their respective menu.

In future versions the menus and directories they look in could be more dynamic.
